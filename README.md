This repository has example problem statements for students to work on. For each problem statement there will be a short description. If and when I am able I will post a starter file for each.
* Exercise 1: [rightmost.asm](rightmost/rightmost.asm)  
Problem Statement: Find the rightmost bit that is set (1) in the binary representation of a given number N  
----
* Exercise 2: [bitRis.asm](bitRis/bitRis.asm)  
Problem Statement: Find bit r (0 to 15) of the binary representation of a given number N  
----
* Exercise 3: [qANDr.asm](qANDr/qANDr.asm) [Inputs.asm](qANDr/Inputs.asm)  
Problem Statment: What is the quotient and remainder of X divided by N. X and N are given, write Q and R to memory    
----
* Exercise 4:  
Problem Statement: Find the r'th largest element in an array of N elements stored at location x4500. r and N are given  
----  
* Exercise 5:  
Problem Statement: Find the most frequently occurring number in an array of numbers stored at location x5000. The numbers are terminated by a -1 and can range from 0 to 9. Write the result after the end of the array. 
----  
* Exercise 6:  
Problem Statement: Sort an array of student records by their Totals. You are given an array of pointers, where each pointer is an address to a student record - The array is null-terminated. Each record contains a student's scores on assignments, exams and programs followed by a Total which you have to calculate. So, the processing is done in two steps: a) Calculate the Totals for each student  
b) Sort the records by keeping the records where they are and simply moving the pointers in the array.
